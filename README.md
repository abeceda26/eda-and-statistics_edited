# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

> Repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis for the animal shelter in Austin, Texas, USA. 
In this project, I have analyzed the animal shelter data to gain insights into the shelter's operations and outcomes.

I have performed data wrangling to ensure that the data is in the right format and ready for analysis. 

- Then I have started with `Univariate descriptive statistics` to understand the distribution of each variable in the dataset. 
This analysis helped me to identify outliers, missing values, and other data issues that required further investigation.

- Next, I have used `Bivariate descriptive statistics` to explore the relationships between variables. 
This analysis helped me to identify potential correlations and dependencies that exist between the variables in the dataset.

Throughout the analysis, I have used graphs and charts to visually represent my observations. 
These graphs and charts help to convey my findings in an easy-to-understand way.

Overall, this EDA project provides a comprehensive overview of the animal shelter in Austin, Texas, USA. 
The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform decisions related to shelter operations, animal welfare, and adoption rates.
